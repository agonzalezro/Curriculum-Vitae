% PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
%

One of the parts I like the most about our field is its community scene, for that reason apart of my day to day job
I spend some time organizing events such as \href{https://www.meetup.com/mad-scalability/}{madScalability} or
the first \href{https://golanguk.com/}{Golang UK conference} as well as speaking in them,
for example, I did that at \href{https://www.kubecon.io}{Kubecon}, \href{https://www.gophercon.co.uk/}{Gophercon} or \href{https://codemotionworld.com/}{Codemotion}.\\
\\
I also have some FLOSS projects that can be checked on \href{https://github.com/agonzalezro}{my GitHub profile}.
To be fair, the most interesting work I did is mainly closed source but I keep myself updated doing some small contributions to interesting projects as \href{https://github.com/agonzalezro/cri-o}{cri-o}, \href{https://github.com/containers/image}{image} and others.
When I had the opportunity of working professionally in the OpenSource space I did the Flocker plugin for Kubernetes: \href{https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/14328}{pr\#14328}.\\

\subsection{Professional experience}
\cventry{Nov'16--Cur.}
{Tech lead}
{BBVA Next}{Spain}{}
{Working on a Platform As A Service project for the BBVA core banking processes.\\
Our main concern as a team is to comply and enforce the different SLAs defined in our platform. Since our colleagues deploy high sensitive applications that move and manage money, the Platform not only has to work, it has to provide enough feedback for different teams to successfully run their applications.\\
As a Tech Lead, I’m in constant contact with the Product team. I work on technical definitions. I make sure that the code committed follows the high standards defined by business, manage and mentor fellow developers and I try to be as accessible as possible to the other business units.\\}

\cventry{Oct'15--Oct'16}
{Software architect}
{Jobandtalent}{Spain}{}
{Working towards a migration to Docker services from development with
  Docker Compose and internal tools (Go \& Ruby) all the way up to
  production with ECS. Terraform and Packer were also involved here.\\
  Started the migration to terraform infrastructure.\\
Development of a geolocation service that consumes MaxMind DB, GMaps and
internal data.\\
Planning of the bounded context of the services in the new revision of the
architecture and the new API guidelines.\\
Investigation of possible future technology choices as grpc, terraform, GKE\ldots\\}

\cventry{Sept'15--Oct 2015}

\cventry{Oct'14--Sept 2015}
{Developer}

Flask, Django or Revel.\\}

work was doing code-reviews too.\\}
